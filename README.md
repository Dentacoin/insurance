# Dental insurance

The Dentacoin Insurance is a smart contract rather than classical insurance. 
A classical insurance is collection money from the many, cover the risk from some and make profit from all. 
Growing risk is followed by higher fees which makes it too burdensome for individuals. 
A typical "no-future-model" because people cant pay for higher and higher fees. 
The Insurance starts to reduce the risks they pay for! 
That’s why global "state of the art" dental solutions have to be payed from people and they cant!
This new and unique Dentacoin-Model is a smart contract between an individual and a dentist. 
The smart contract is tradable if both parties do agree and all smart contracts together are part of "super-smart-contract“. 
The super smart contracts are providing a safe net for the patient
in the form of a guarantee in case of death or insolvency of the dentist.
Because the smart contract is tradeable in the blockchain it creates an own value as a product.
Because patient and dentist will have 100% the same interest: keep the teeth healthy! 
And because the guarantee only saves the patient if he fulfills his care policy for which he gets constant reminders on his app. 
Moreover, because the dentist knows that he has to save, heal and replace the teeth of his smart contract partner
at his own expense, both, dentist and patient win money if the purpose of keeping the patients oral health
up to standard is met!
